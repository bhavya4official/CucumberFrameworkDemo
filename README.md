Cucumber BDD with Selenium POM design pattern.

### Cucumber is an open-source BDD tool used to develop test cases for the behaviour of software's functionality testing.

Cucumber Framework executes automated acceptance tests written in the “Gherkin” language. Gherkin is a domain-specific language for behaviour descriptions. Gherkin is business-readable.

Cucumber test automation makes use of these important files:
1. Feature file – Contains code written in Gherkin (plain English text: Given, When, Then) 
2. Step definition file – Contains the actual code written by the developer
3. Test Runner File - It executes the Cucumber feature files and coordinates the steps defined in those feature files with the corresponding step definitions.

### Behaviour-driven Development (BDD) is a software development technique that has evolved from TDD (Test Driven Development), which is an approach or programming practice where the developers write new code only when the automated test case fails.
